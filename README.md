This archive :octocat: will record all my working codes when I am in the core facility at 
Guozhong B201 (sklcvd[sklcvd](http://www.sklcvd.org)) from 2017-12. 

My major task is to develop and implements quality control pipelines to evaluate the NGS data generated 
from various groups in Guozhong.

I created several folders which will be the deposited to save the raw code 
when I perform the required task. The tracking code will be disseminated to my 
collaborators for their lab log usage.

current task list (need update)
- [x] implement and maintain quality control pipeline for the NGS studies
- [ ] Genome wide association studies (GWAS), DNA-seq
- [ ] Epigenentic data analysis, ChIP-seq, ATAT-seq etc.
- [ ] transcriptomic analysis including mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, etc.
- [ ] Matabolomic analysis
- [ ] Other X-omics data or high-through-put data
