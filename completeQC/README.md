# quality control pipeline using industry standard

## Project aim

This project is the initial step to provide a deep service 
for the NGS platform users at GuoZhong to pre-analyze their data from
the outside sequencing services. This tool is suggested to be used
as an independent source to assess the sequencing results, which include, 
but not limited to,
[] ribomosme rRNA comtainiation
[] check the strandedness of the library
[] check the read length
[] check the unique mapping reads percentage
